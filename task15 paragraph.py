paragraph='''When you started coding in Python, you'd have used the built-in print() function in your Hello World! program ðŸ˜€ and the input() 
function to read in input from the user. So long as you know how to use these functions, you don't have to worry about how they've been implemented.
In programming, this is called abstraction. It lets you use functions by calling the function with required arguments, without having to worry about
how they actually work. There's a whole wealth of built-in functions in Python. In this post, we shall see how we can define and use our own 
functions. Let's get started!'''
